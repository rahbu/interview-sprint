// 1. We want a new component 'custom' that shows a number between 1 and 10 with a button on the left '-' and a button on the right '+' that decrement and increment respectively.

// 2. Set up app.component.ts as a form with three fields: area, total, and rate.  The area field should use the new custom component.

// 3. Can you modify the form so that whenever either total or rate are modified, the other input switches according to the formula rate = total/area?
